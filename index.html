                    Hi, I’m Hamzah. I’m a computer science student at the University of Guelph with a minor in project management. 
                    My interest in technology started with watching TV shows and movies like Shark Tank and The Social Network. 
                    What I liked about technology was how accessible it was. Learning to code allows you to create anything you
                    can think of. There is no bureaucracy with it. It has the power to be revolutionary.

                    At 17, I knew I wanted to build new companies for a living, and I combined my confidence and extroverted personality
                    with a love for startups. I started working at a San Francisco startup called EOXS. 
                    They were a software-as-a-service building enterprise resource planning software for 
                    steel contractors; think of it as the Amazon for steel. At EOXS, I was a sales and 
                    marketing intern. I found the work monotonous, with the ability to be automated.
                    Doing this kind of repetitive work sparked my initial interest in automation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After graduating high school, I decided to pursue an honors bachelor of computing, co-op computer science 
                    degree at the University of Guelph. The summer before my first year, I worked with a third-year Guelph 
                    Computer Engineering major on building Birbl, an AI search engine custom-made for large organizations, 
                    allowing for fast retrieval of large documents. I did their front-end web development using tools such 
                    as React and JavaScript. Unfortunately, the startup fell apart, but it was a great learning experience.

                <p>
                    As the first year started, I started getting adjusted to university life. I became a campus ambassador 
                    for Jarvis Consulting Group, learned C and manual memory management, and started building my projects.
                    The summer of my first year had me interning at a technology consultancy with operations in the Middle East. 
                    This job was the hardest I have had so far, as I was working 14-15 hours a day trying to make professional
                     API endpoints and web app components. I remember how much I struggled with GIT, as learning how to solve
                    merge conflicts felt scary. There were a few times when I would be finished with a complex feature and 
                    would commit only to have it magically erased from my computer, and I would have to start over.

                    I wish I could say I got everything fast and still had a work-life balance, but that summer was truly the worst. 
                    I neglected my friends, my loved ones, and myself. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t try to know everything.
                    I don’t know. I know better now, but she’s gone, so it’s too late. You know I was so scared of failing out of the CS program;
                    I worked so hard to do it all. Get good grades, build projects, and get work experience. But if I could do it all over, 
                    I wouldn’t have worked so hard. You always think you have time left with those you love. But you don’t; learn from 
                    my mistakes and live every day like it’s your last.

                    When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me lowballing people on Facebook Marketplace and bawling my eyes out because 
                    I’m not God’s strongest soldier. I believe in maintaining a balance between work and personal life, but I am struggling
                    at the moment because work and school are very demanding. My goal is to use technology to solve meaningful problems 
                    and make a positive impact. Please give me a nice mark, because the Angel of Death has destroyed every fibre of my being,
                    and I want to survive. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio.
